<p>Kia ora!</p>
<p>My name is Palin Wiseman and I'm a student at Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand in my third year. I am graduating in November with a Bachelor of Information Technology in the Game Development pathway. I am queer and non-binary and my pronouns are they/them.</p>
<p>I am passionate about gaming and want to work as a developer in the game dev industry. I have 2 years of experience working with Unity and C# and have worked with Unreal Engine 5, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
<p>My current side project is a Raspberry Pi controlled display for Formula 1 lap times that can open driver POV windows.</p>
